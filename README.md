# Analog Clock King

This project is a fun analog clock web app inspired by the DC Comics character [Clock King](https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Clock_King). The clock faces are styled to look like Clock King's iconic glasses, and the background features an image of the character.

## Features

- Two analog clocks with custom hands and face designs
- Responsive layout and themed background
- Animated clock hands using JavaScript
- Custom fonts and colors for a classic look

## How It Works

- The clock faces are drawn using HTML and styled with CSS.
- JavaScript (`logic.js`) updates the rotation of the clock hands every second.
- The background image is of the night sky([source](https://geographical.co.uk/science-environment/tips-and-tricks-for-astrophotography)).
