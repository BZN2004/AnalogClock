# Analog Clock King

This project is a fun analog clock web app inspired by the DC Comics character [Clock King](https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Clock_King). The clock faces are styled to look like 2 moons in the night sky, and the background features an image of the night sky.

## Features

- Two analog clocks with custom hands and face designs
- Responsive layout and themed background
- Animated clock hands using JavaScript
- Custom fonts and colors for a classic look

## How It Works

- The clock faces are drawn using HTML and styled with CSS.
- JavaScript (`logic.js`) updates the rotation of the clock hands every second.
- The background image is of the night sky([source](https://geographical.co.uk/science-environment/tips-and-tricks-for-astrophotography)).

## Comments

- I made this in 5 hrs the biggest issue was getting the points of time and hands to actually make sense all in all it took a littile trial and error and some maths(its good enough). 

- The Clock on the left does not function not because it does not work but because its just the doom clock nothing more.

- Next up I'll be making a daily journal (I'm thinking a Death note vibe ).
